          We provide you with your daily 'ME Moment'. Amidst the hustle and
          bustle of city life, a visit to one of our Coffeeshops <br /> offers
          relaxation and inspiration at the same time. With the combination of a
          pleasant atmosphere and an urban backdrop, <br /> we create a setting
          in which you become the main character.
